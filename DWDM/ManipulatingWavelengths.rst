Manipulating Wavelengths
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++


#. Point-to-point only:
	- all waves going in Site A come out at Site B
#. FOADM - Fixed Optical Add/Drop Multiplexer
	- cheap hardware, but requires manual configuration on Site B
	- add/drop pre-determined channels at intermediate sites and pass remaining channels through without demultiplexing
#. ROADM - Reconfigurable Optical Add/Drop Multiplexer
	- automates wave manipulation to create larger networks
	- it contains WSS (Wavelength Selective Switch)
	- it can add/drop/passthrough wavelengths via remote provisioning
	- you can reconfigure the paths to avoid cable cuts or create maintenance window

Types of ROADMs:

#. Static,
#. Colorless (C),
#. Colorless-Directionless (CD),
#. Colorless-Directionless-Contentionless (CDC).
