Fiber cable is a waveguide for light.

The speed of light in any particular material is expressed as a ratio of speed of light in vacuum and that material refractive index, n.

When light is passing from one medium to another with a different index of refraction, a total reflection can occur instead.

Fiber cable consists of two layers:

#. core
#. cladding

Cladding always has a higher index of refraction than the core.

If the source of light into the fiber has incident angle within the "acceptance cone", total reflection occurs at the edge between core and cladding.

The vast majority of deployed fiber optic systems operate as "duplex" or as a fiber pair.

But, fiber is perfectly capable of carrying many signals, in both directions, over a single strand. It just requires more expensive optical components to do so. It is typically reserved for systems where the fiber in question is relatively expensive (e.g. fiber going across the ocean).
