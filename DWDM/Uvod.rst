   These are the notes taken from this video: `Optical Networking / DWDM Basics (Dense Wave Division Multiplexing) <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T31CQ3KdDN0&t=1268s>`_

- C-band 1528nm - 1568nm
- L-band 1568nm - 1610nm

Gray optics: 1310nm

DWDM is the only system that delivers:

#. increased capacity and
#. increased distance
