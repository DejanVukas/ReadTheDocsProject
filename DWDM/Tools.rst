Signal and fiber health monitoring

Optical Power Meter (Light Meter)
=====================================

Measures the brightness of an optical signal.

Has two modes of operation:

#. Absolute optical power in mW or relative optical power in dBm, and
#. Relative optical power loss in dB

"Relative loss" mode - result is in dB (not in dBm) - it is designed to work with a known power light source on the other end, to test the amount of loss over a particular fiber strand.

.. caution::
   Very often wrong mode of operation is selected and optical power meter readings are misinterpreted! It the readings are in dB, it is relative optical power loss, and not optical power (which is in mW or dBm)!

OTDR (Optical Time-Domain Reflectometer)
=============================================

OTDR helps you predict and react to fiber failures.

Enables fault location to within meters.

Injects a series of light pulses into a fiber strand.

Used to characterize a fiber, with information like:

- splice points and their locations,
- overall fiber attenuation,
- fiber breaks and their locations (distance from the end-point).
