Optical Power Meter (Light Meter)
=====================================

Measures the brightness of an optical signal.

Has two modes of operation:

#. Absolute optical power in mW or dBm, and
#. Relative optical power in dB

"Relative loss" mode - result is in dB (not in dBm) - it is designed to work with a known power light source on the other end, to test the amount of loss over a particular fiber strand.

OTDR (Optical Time-Domain Reflectometer)
=============================================

Injects a series of light pulses into a fiber strand.

Used to characterize a fiber, with information like:

- splice points and their locations,
- overall fiber attenuation,
- fiber breaks and their locations (distance from the end-point).
