DWDM grids
+++++++++++++

Fixed grid 100GHz (0.8nm)
===========================

- 100GHz spaced center-frequencies
- 44 channels in C-band

Fixed grid 50GHz (0.4nm)
=========================

- 50GHz spaced center-frequencies
- 88/96 channels in C-band

Flex grid 6.25GHz
====================

- Center frequencies are at 6.25GHz increments
- Width of each channel is N x 12.5GHz

DWDM Superchannels
====================

For large bandwidth channels requiring carriers.

Efficiency can be improved by removing the guardbands.
