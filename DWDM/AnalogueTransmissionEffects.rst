   * - Effect
     - Mitigation
   * - Optical Attenuation (Loss)
     - Amplifiers
   * - Dispersion
     - Dispersion compensation
   * - Non-linear effects
     - Overcome it with proper optical network design
   * - The fiber is physically damaged
     - Automated network, OTDR measurements.

In case of optical attenuation, -OSNR becomes too low - receiver cannot detect the signal from the noise.

Colour dispersion - pulses of light spread out as they travel. Receiver cannot distinguish one pulse from another.

Non-linear effects - - wavelengths can trample on other wavelengths.
