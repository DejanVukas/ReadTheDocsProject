   * - Effect
     - Mitigation
   * - Optical Attenuation (Loss)
       -OSNR becomes too low
     - Amplifiers
   * - Dispersion
       - Colour dispersion, pulses of light spread out as they travel
       - Receiver cannot distinguish one pulse from another
     - Dispersion compensation
   * - Non-linear effects
       - Wavelengths can trample on other wavelengths
     - Overcome it with proper optical network design
   * - The fiber is physically damaged
     - Automated network, OTDR measurements.
