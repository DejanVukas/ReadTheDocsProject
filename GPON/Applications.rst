GPON Applications
++++++++++++++++++

Fiber-to-the-home is regarded as the major application for PON. The reduced cabling infrastructure and flexible media transmission attributes of passive optical networks have made it an ideal fit for home Internet, voice, and video applications. Besides, the PON network is also suitable in different environments like college campuses and business complexes.

PON networks also have potentials for the 5G fronthaul applicationsâ€”deploying PON networks to complete the fronthaul connections can reduce fiber count and improve efficiency without compromising performance, meeting the bandwidth and latency demands imposed by 5G.
