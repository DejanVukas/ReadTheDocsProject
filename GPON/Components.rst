Optical Line Terminal (OLT)
=============================

Device that aggregates all optical signals from ONTs into a single multiplexed beam of light which is then converted into an electrical signal, formatted to Ethernet packet type standards for Layer 2 or Layer 3 forwarding.

The OLT is connected to the Wide Area Network (WAN) through the core router.

Todayâ€™s OLTs support both Passive Optical Networking service modules that allow XFP selectable ITU-T 984 G-PON 2.5G or ITU-T G.9807/G.987 XGS-PON symmetrical 10G connectivity down to the ONTs.

Splitters
===============

Optical splitters provide the point-to-multipoint connectivity between the OLT and the ONTs. They offer split ratios from 1:2 up to 1:64 with the most common split ration being 1:32. Optical splitters also provide equipment, fiber and services protection through 2:X redundancy options. They are unmanaged, unpowered and highly reliable.

Splitters are used to aggregate or multiplex fiber optic signals to a single upstream fiber optical cable. Usually 1:32 ratio.

Split ratio: Restricted by path loss, PON with passive splitters (16,32, or 64 way split)

Optical Network Termination (ONT)
=======================================

ONTs enables optical to electrical conversion and Ethernet connectivity for voice, video, data, Wi-Fi and all other digital enterprise services and devices. ONTs are Power over Ethernet (PoE) enabled and subtend other powered devices (e.g. phones, cameras, wireless access points). ONTs themselves can be either locally powered from a nearby AC outlet, or remotely powered from a DC source.

Connects end-user devices (desktop, phones, and so on) into the GPON network. Provides the optical to electrical signal conversion. ONTs also provide AES encryption via ONT key.
