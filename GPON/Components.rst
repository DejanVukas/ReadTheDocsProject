Optical Line Terminal (OLT)
=============================

Device that aggregates all optical signals from ONTs into a single multiplexed beam of light which is then converted into an electrical signal, formatted to Ethernet packet type standards for Layer 2 or Layer 3 forwarding.

Splitters
===============

Splitters are used to aggregate or multiplex fiber optic signals to a single upstream fiber optical cable. Usually 1:32 ratio.

Split ratio: Restricted by path loss, PON with passive splitters (16,32, or 64 way split)

Optical Network Termination (ONT)
=======================================

Connects end-user devices (desktop, phones, and so on) into the GPON network. Provides the optical to electrical signal conversion. ONTs also provide AES encryption via ONT key.
