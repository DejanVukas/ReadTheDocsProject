As part of GPON, loss of optical power must be accounted for. This loss can be introduced in a variety of ways, such as:

#. Loss within splitters
#. Loss per km of fiber (About 0.35 dB per km for 1310, 1490 nm)
#. Loss in splices ( > 0.2 dB) 
#. Connector loss (0.6 dB)
#. Fiber bending

The amount of loss incurred from use of various splitters:
