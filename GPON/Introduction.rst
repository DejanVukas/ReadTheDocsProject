GPON (Gigabit Passive Optical Network) is an alternative to Ethernet switching in campus networking. GPON replaces the traditional three-tier Ethernet design with a two-tier optic network which eliminates access and distribution Ethernet switches with passive optical devices.

GPON adopts WDM to transmit data of different upstream/downstream wavelengths over the same ODN (Optical Distribution Network).

Data is broadcast in the downstream direction, and in the upstream direction data is burst in TDMA mode (based on timeslots).

Maximum differential fiber distance: 20km
